This project is the result of a groupwork done for our Virtual Reality class.

The idea was to create a serious game that would confront the "patients" to their fear of heights. 
Different environments situated in a skyscraper in New-York allow the player to confront himself with various heights.

Four different levels were created : 1st level with only a window showing the view, 2nd level with a bay window, 3rd level with a balcony and finally a 4th level representing a rooftop. A bonus level exists : a platform situated on the rooftop which is the most difficult step.
